I work as a Software Developer, and I have a bit of entrepreneurial streak in me. Growing up, I wasn't exposed to Computer Science and I had no idea what a programmer was. As hard as it may be to believe in 2022, there's someone out there right now who is also missing that same exposure, and probably has the mind and ability to pursue a route in tech as a Software Engineer. I transitioned after 6 years in Logistics and obtaining two degrees. That someone hopefully won't have to wait until they are already in a career to be exposed.

Making money is cool. Building products with code that people actually use is fascinating. I have consumed a lot of content in this space over the last 7 years, and now I'm working on my own. Two Hands, a brain, and a little consistent hard work can change your life. My interest is in online/digital business. Specifically, I gravitate towards solo founder/small team, bootstrapped, and indie hacker type businesses. I'm currently working on my first. I've been engulfed in the online business community since 2015 when I was exposed to Affiliate Marketing while bored in one of my prior roles.

In addition to content centered around building businesses, you can expect walkthrough, tutorial, and "how-to" based content on things that I've learned as I grow in my career as a developer. Not only does this help you, but it also serves as a reference for me if I run across the issue again. The technical interview process doesn't really reflect what a day to day developer does, but that doesn't negate the fact that most good job opportunities still have an interview process that requires a nice understanding of data structures and algorithms. I haven't made it to the promised land of 100% entrepreneur, so as I work through new problems, I'll also document those here as well.

Realizing my potential and acting on it is my only focus. I have a things say. I'll be giving my takes on the latest happenings in the tech industry, personal projects I'm working through, updates on my career, and the occasional take on pop culture.
