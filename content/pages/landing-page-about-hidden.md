### The Present
<!-- Subtitle: Background|The Present|The Future|Reader Expectations|Interests -->
Realizing my potential and acting on it is my only focus. I work as a Software Developer and have a bit of entrepreneurial streak in me, pivoting after 6 years in Logistics and obtaining two non-CS degrees. Technically, I'm a late bloomer, and wasn't exposed to Computer Science until late adulthood and had no idea what a programmer was. Yes, it's 2022, but somewhere, there's a smart 16 year old kid in the boonies that has no relative, individual they relate to, or resources to get a sneak peek into the tech industry. 

### The Future
Money in tech is a really big topic, and it's cool. Building valuable products with code that make you money is even better, but isn't as big of a topic. I've consumed an enormous amount of content in the online business space over the last 7 years, and I'm finally working on my own. Two Hands, a brain, and consistent hard work can change your life. My interests are in digital products. Specifically, I gravitate towards solo founder/small team, bootstrapped, and indie hacker type businesses.

### Reader Expectations 
In addition to content centered around building businesses online, you can expect walk-through, tutorial, and "how-to" based content that stem from problems in my career. Not only does this help you, but it also serves as a reference point for me if I run across the issue again. Additionally, the interview process for early career Software Engineers requires a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms which is a job within itself. There will be posts navigating this process as well.

Stay tuned for my personal takes on the latest happenings in the tech industry, personal speed bumps and triumphs, career talk, and the occasional take on pop culture.
